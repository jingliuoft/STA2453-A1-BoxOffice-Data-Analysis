    "**Summary:** The film industry has grown immensely over the past few decades generating billions of dollars of revenue for the stakeholders. It would be very helpful for movie producers and directors to have some reference of profitability, or chance of receiving positive comments or awards based on past histories. Motivating from these interests, in this project, the movie reviews by the New York Times (NYT) and box offices of the movies in the past four years have been analyzed. The analysis tried to answer 1) what characteristics of movies affect NYT's choice to write a general review or listed as 'Crisic's Pick'? 2) does NTY reviews influence the box office? and 3) what characteristics of movies affect revenue? Review information from NYT Movie Reviews and movie information from movie databases such as OMDB, IMDB and the Numbers were extracted, cleaned and analyzed. Analysis result indicates that ...\n",

    "The film industry has grown immensely over the past few decades generating billions of dollars of revenue for the stakeholders. It would be very helpful for the movie producers and directors if there is a prediction system to assess the box office of new movies. It would increase the chance of profitablity and box office success when movie producers and directors need to make decision when making movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Movies are one of the most common entertainment for people nowadays. With easy access to Internet, audiences like to give comments to movies. This leads to the populairty of many movie review websites, such as IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, etc. Besides the review websites, traditional media is still contributing on the movie reviews nowadays. For example, New York Times hosted a section on their website for movie reviews. Thoses scores and reviews could influence people's decision on whether to go and watch a movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "For NYT movie reviews, critics often give their reviews a few days before the film is released. They comment on different aspects of the movies and indicate a 'Critic's Pick' if the movie is highly recommended to watch. People would like to go thearter to watch a high recommomded movie, and avoid to spend money on badly scored movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the critics' reviews, there are various factors that impact the box office, i.e. genre, story plot, director, celebreties in the cast. Nevertheless, timing of the release could affect box office, too. It is common to see more crowded thearter during December and other holiday seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the movie reviews by the New York Times (NYT) and box offices of the movies in the past five years have been analyzed. Three main questions were discussed and presented in this report:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. What characteristics of movies affect NYT's choice to write a general review or listed as 'Crisic's Pick'?** To be more specific, what types of the movies appear more frequently in NTY reviews? Do writers have preferred types when selecting 'Critic's Pick'?\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Does NTY reviews influence the box office?** Is there any different on the impact between general review articles and those marked as 'Critic's Pick'? Does the sentiment from NYT articles affected the box office?\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What characteristics of movies affect revenue?** Can we forecast the movie box office?\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis is based on the movie reviews and other movie data for the past 5 years (2014 to 2018). There were no restrictions on the genre or any other characteristics on the movies that were analyzed. Detailed scope of the analysis will be described in next section.\n",

    "For the work has been done in the study, I orgainzed the report in this way: First introduced data collection and data cleaning based on study objectives. Followed by second part on Insights Exploration from collected data. Subsequently, a prediction model was built and tested by using Neural Network algorithm. Last part discussed on the limitations and conclusion of this study and further improvement for further research and study.\n"

Through OMDB open API, the movie data such as movie actors, director, box office, ratings from IMDB, Metacritics, Rotten Tomatoes, awards, etc. is extracted. Addtionally, we extracted movie budget data from IMDB website.\n",

    "In this study, we looked into analysis the datasets from New York Times and OMDB on movie data, to find out the relation between New York Times article and boxoffice. Here are some conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For both review aritcle and critics' pick, Drama took the highest frequency. It could due to drama movies took a large market ratio and also could because writers prefer drama movies because people enjoys to watch this type of movie thus interested in reviews of drama movies as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The boxoffice looked similar for review articles and critics' pick.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. There is a statisic significant relation between review sentiment and critics' pick, the logistic regression summary support it with p-value < 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. we built the linear regression model, aimed to predict the boxoffice. However, although we achieved significant p-value for most of the factors, the residual-fits plots doesn't appear randomly and in another word the model didn't fit the data well. It could because miss out important factor."

    "For this three datasets, there are common issues that there are plenty of null data. In this study, most of the time we dropped the null value, to ease the calculation but it could lead us to miss out the important pattern or info from the missing value. In further study, we need to think about interpretation for the missing value (null value).\n",

    "There are many other good factors that could be very useful for movie boxoffice prediction. For further study, we should include more possible factors to build the forecasting model."
